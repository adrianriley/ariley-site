<h1 align="center">Comments on the 2002-2003 Season</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>
A season which started brightly enough fell away disastrously towards the end.
Top of the table after four games, Spurs descended gently over the next two months
until they reached a plateau around sixth/seventh position. This kept hopes
of a place in European competition next season alive until the final few weeks,
when a dreadful sequence saw the club, instead of challenging for the final
place in Europe, collapse to tenth in the table. This, combined with early
exit from both cups, a humiliating defeat at Burnley in the Worthington, a
thrashing at Southampton in the FA, meant that the season has to be viewed
as a failure.
<p>
A welter of recrimination surrounded the club during the bad days of spring,
with media commentators, current and former players questioning the ability of manager
Glenn Hoddle to motivate his players. Rumours of bust ups between manager,
coaches, captain and senior players kept the media interested and fans of
other clubs amused. On current form, Spurs already look relegation candidates
for next season. But possible arrivals and departures during the summer
means that we will approach next August once again hoping that Spurs can do
something to justify their self image as one of the big clubs of British football,
a status which they have not held in reality since the 1980s (or some might say
since the 1960s).
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>
So what went wrong this year? Well, Hoddle denies that there is unrest
or low morale in the dressing room, but if his man management and motivational skills
are not the problem, then we are in real trouble, because in that case we've got
a lot of players who aren't good enough and a lot more who can't be bothered to show
whether they are.
<p>
A glance at the "Goals Against" column in the table certainly
points up one issue. Despite having some of the best regarded defenders in the
country, we conceded more goals than any team outside the bottom two. Clean
sheets in two of the first three games were followed by just three more in the
rest of the season, none since January. Injuries certainly didn't
help, we must have played a dozen different line ups and nearly as many different
formations, but all sides get injuries, we should be used to it by now.
Defensive organisation is a shambles,
and as well as chasing players the club would be well advised to recruit a
coach who can teach the players how to defend as a unit. As a start, it would
be worth pointing out that defending is not just the responsibility of defenders.
Time and again we see midfield players standing around the centre circle
while a desperate defence is overrun by a quick break. It might be useful to
analyse how many goals were conceded as a result of a Spurs attack breaking down,
and how often that was because of the inability to play a simple pass.
The lack of pace in the side makes it hard to defend in that situation, those
at the back are left hopelessly exposed. I believe we also conceded more
penalties than any other side in the Premiership.
<p>
Central midfield is obviously a key area for any side, and we just didn't cut it.
Too easily overrun when defending, not creative enough when attacking. Neither
Freund nor Bunjevcevic was really effective as a holding player, and the lack
of pace was a real problem just getting up and down the field. Looking at the
players the top sides have, we don't have anything like the equivalent of, say,
Keane (Roy), or Viera and Gilberto, or Gerrard. The lack of movement throughout the
side (Keane excepted) has been a problem for years. How often we see players
move to a position then just stand watching as the play develops, or fails to.
<p>
Then up front, although we scored a decent number of goals compared to the rest,
it wasn't enough to compensate for the leaky defence. In many games, we enjoyed
a good deal of possession without actually making many chances. In the final
few matches, we created almost nothing. And apart from our strikers, we have
few scoring options. Poyet and Davies have 6 and 5 goals respectively, Redknapp 3,
Richards and Ziege two each. Anderton failed to score at all, which is appalling.
<p>
In general, we seem to find it hard to do the simple things. A throw-in to Spurs almost
always results in the ball being lost. I don't see this happening to other teams,
but they know that only one player will make himself available to receive the
ball, put pressure on him and you win it. How many corners, whether from
Anderton, Ziege, Carr, Redknapp, Davies or whoever, are cleared by the first
defender, without even getting as far as the near post? Do the players actually
practice these things? And so often, simple passes of a few yards just fail to
reach their target.
<p>
In the past, I've often thought that Spurs play better against the better teams,
and playing against the lesser teams we seem to come down to their level. But
this year, against the top five sides we managed just two points from ten games.
I think that shows how far behind them we are.
<h2>Transfers</h2>
<p>
The problem this summer is the same as that of last summer,
without European competition we will not attract the big names, and in chasing
them, less feted but possibly more suitable players will be snapped up by other
clubs. In addition, the club does not have vast amounts of money to spend, and
seem happier making offers well below a target's current club's valuation and
seeing them rejected. This process has already started, with Charlton turning
down an offer for Scott Parker, involving a swap with Matthew Etherington but
not coming close to their £5 million valuation. At least
this approach to transfer dealing meant that we managed to avoid signing 
Michael Ricketts during the January transfer window. But you do feel that some
of it is just window dressing to keep the fans happy, and the club are not
actually interested in signing particular players, making offers which they
know will be rejected.
<p>
The team needs to be strenghthened in all areas. With Sheringham and Freund
definitely gone, the rest of the old guard have a limited shelf life,
particularly Poyet, who could be offloaded if anyone will take him.
Etherington, Sullivan and Doherty might be makeweights in swap deals.
Players I'd be happy to see the back of include Thatcher, Perry, Acimovic,
Bunjevcevic, but the chances of anyone wanting any of them seem quite slim.
Iversen also could probably go, again depending on finding a mug to take him.
Carr seems likely to leave, which is bad news, he's the best full back in
the Premier League, and there'll be no shortage of bidders. Of the others,
we must keep the nucleus of the younger players coming through, i.e. Keane of 
course, King, Davies, Gardner. Redknapp and Richards will be staying; of the
others, who knows?
<p>
Likely targets to bring in include just about anyone who plays football, if
you read all the tabloid rumours. It's a pity that some of the names most
often mentioned are players who I don't want to see at the club, e.g. Lee
Bowyer (fortunately now gone to Newcastle), Emile Heskey.
Bobby Zamora also comes up frequently, but he's unproven
at the top level, and has hardly set Division One alight this season, though
I think he's been injured. There are loads of players who might improve the side,
but as I've said, how many are likely to come to Spurs? I'd like to see a
more coherent buying policy, so that we have a chance of ending up with a team
rather than a collection of individuals who don't really fit together, which
is what we seem to have had for some time. And we've got to avoid recruiting
more over 30s looking for a nice wage packet to support them in their
declining years.
<h2>Player assessments</h2>
Here are personal assessments of individual players:
<h3>1. Neil Sullivan</h3>
<p>
Didn't play, but still managed to spend half the season out injured. Probably
not too unhappy about that, looking at the work Kasey had to put in.
Surely can't be content to sit on the bench for another season?
<h3>2. Steven Carr</h3>
<p>
Unfortunate to be injured in the first match after missing all of last season.
Didn't look fit when he did come back, but regained something like his best
form towards the end of the season. Included in the Premiership team of the
season, though that says something about the quality of defenders in the league.
With just two years left on his contract, and reluctant to agree an extension,
seems likely to depart in the summer so the club can maximise the price,
either to replace Gary Neville or team up again with his former captain.
<h3>3. Mauricio Taricco</h3>
<p>
His reputation goes before him. A nasty little player. Never been much more 
than an adequate defender,
and is hardly going to improve now. Doesn't help himself by getting involved
in spats with various people he's wound up over the years. I find it irritating
that, although he can use his left foot, he always cuts inside on his right when
going forward. First goal for Spurs against Liverpool was a top comedy moment.
<h3>4. Steffen Freund</h3>
<p>
Played some reasonable games over the winter, within his limitations. At least
he seemed to care about the result. Irritated Glenn by his comments on Spurs
lack of passion and commitment after the gutless FA Cup defeat at Southampton,
and so was cast into the outer darkness. Has now left the club, his contract
not being renewed. His tantrums when disagreeing with a refereeing
decision will be missed.
<h3>5. Goran Bunjevcevic</h3>
<p>
Too weak to be a defender, too aimless to be an attacker, can't pass, can't
tackle, can't head, can't shoot. Something of a disappointment.
<h3>6. Chris Perry</h3>
<p>
A decent defender, reasonable tackler, good marker. Unfortunately, a liability
when he has the ball. His better passes go into the crowd, the others go straight
to an opponent, sometimes near, sometimes far away, but with absolute precision.
<h3>7. Darren Anderton</h3>
<p>
Missed the first three months, but played most of the rest of the season.
Much as expected, reasonable passer but hardly inspired, good crosser but can't
get a corner past the first defender. Does more defensive work than some of
his colleagues. But the pace has gone, and his goal scoring too.
<h3>9. Les Ferdinand</h3>
<p>
Started the season in lively fashion, even scored twice. But sidelined after
Keane's arrival. Left for West Ham, and was good enough to score for them
against us. Naturally, his departure was immediately followed by the
traditional striker crisis.
Always seemed a nice man, but we never saw the best of him at
Tottenham.
<h3>10. Teddy Sheringham</h3>
<p>
Should have retired at the end of last season. Never had any pace, but now so
lazy that it's embarrassing. Spent most of the season standing still. Probably
didn't want to tire himself in case of a last minute penalty, which happened
once. The original uninspirational captain, did nothing to try to lift the team
on the bad days.
Has been a great servant to the club, but this was one season too many.
<h3>11. Sergei Rebrov</h3>
<p>
Potentially great asset completely wasted, first by Graham, then by Hoddle.
Never played in his best position, once Teddy arrived never could play there.
His agent's comments irritated Hoddle and therefore declared a non-person.
At least he can't score against us now he's at Galatasary, which would have
been a near certainty if he'd gone to Fulham. What a waste.
<h3>12. Gary Doherty</h3>
<p>
Committed, enthusiastic, never gives up. But certainly not a top class striker,
and seems unlikely to become a top class defender either. Doesn't seem to have
the instincts for
either role, and not a good enough footballer to develop them. Was offerred
to Bolton as part of the failed deal for Ricketts, will probably be offloaded
soon.
<h3>13. Kasey Keller</h3>
<p>
Bit of a mixture. Many fine saves, left exposed far too often by the shambles
in front of him. But decision making often a problem when he has time to think,
conceded needless penalties through ill judged rushes from goal. Sometimes
insecure on crosses. Was probably lucky that Sullivan was injured when his own
form was at its worst. Finally managed to save a penalty, but Juninho walked
in the rebound.
<h3>14. Gus Poyet</h3>
<p>
Apart from six goals, contributed nothing through the season. A mystery why he was
in the side so often. Too slow to get forward or back, easily bypassed in midfield.
A waste of a shirt. And don't forget that he captained the side in the Burnley
game.
<h3>15. Jamie Redknapp</h3>
<p>
Missed half the season with injuries. Not convincing as a midfield playmaker,
too many attempted long passes failed to reach their target. Inventive free kick
routine which never quite came off for him. I always thought
he was recruited to replace Anderton, but then he (Anderton) didn't leave. Difficult to
see how they can play together, neither has any pace and neither gives us much
in the way of defending; fortunately with their fitness records it
could hardly ever happen. Seems keen to play for us though.
<h3>16. Steffen Iversen</h3>
<p>
The real "Sicknote". When he was available, has so obviously lost all confidence
that he was quite hopeless, can't control the ball, tentative with chances,
no movement.
Hard to believe that he will ever fulfil his potential now.
<h3>18. Ben Thatcher</h3>
<p>
Actually managed to contribute a couple of decent games in the early season.
Then lost it again and reverted to Wimbledon style defending. 
Another who irritated our manager by some comments in the
press and wasn't seen again. Difficult to believe that we spent £5 million
plus on him. Even more difficult to believe that he was once talked of as
a potential England player.
<h3>21. Milenko Acimovic</h3>
<p>
Comfortably the worst player at the club. Mainly appeared as substitute, hard
to know why he appeared at all. Plays one decent pass per month, scared to
death of physical contact (I believe that's called <i>failing to adjust to
the English game</i>), can't head, woeful shooting. His miss from two yards
against Fulham seemed to be the start of our decline. Strangely, he is
apparently quite a decent player in the reserves, in which case he should
stay there for good.
<h3>22. Robbie Keane</h3>
<p>
The one real success of the season. Clearly not Hoddle's choice, but forced
into buying him when they finally understood what Morientes was saying. Lively,
quick, tricky, whole hearted player, the new darling of the fans. Top scorer,
with a number of superb goals. But the downside of that is that he doesn't
score many tap-ins. Not a penalty box player in the Lineker mould. It would be 
useful if we could recruit an out-and-out striker to take more advantage of his 
work outside the box, much of it is wasted because support is so slow to arrive.
But generally very encouraging.
<h3>23. Christian Ziege</h3>
<p>
Apart from all the midfielders who don't want to defend, here we have a
defender who doesn't want to. Strong contender for laziest player at the club,
with Teddy and Gus. Still a quality player going forward, good runs, passing
and crossing, great free kick goal against Arsenal will keep his stock high
with most fans. Nice to see him recover from that very worrying injury.
But you sense his best days are behind him, and he knows it.
<h3>26. Ledley King</h3>
<p>
Extremely good defender, fine tackler, quick, comfortable on the ball. Prone to
occassional lapses of concentration, but should improve further with more
experience, and if we could get a settled defence. Doesn't yet have Campbell's
strength and presence, but a better footballer all round. More similar to
Rio Ferdinand really, without the hype and the price tag. Should be in the England squad,
certainly better than Terry or Upson. Also great disciplinary record, no bookings
in 26 games.
<h3>28. Matthew Etherington</h3>
<p>
Like several others, started the season well, got injured and couldn't get back
to form. As a winger, doesn't seem good enough at anything in particular, not
especially quick, not a very good dribbler, not a consistently good crosser,
little goal threat, not a good defender, certainly not a wing-back. 
Needs more variety to his game, had a spell where he always 
cut inside to try to work a shooting position. Ziege is always selected when 
fit, and Matty doesn't really fit into the team shape then. Could be on his way
out, has already been offerred as part of some swap deals.
<h3>29. Simon Davies</h3>
<p>
Another fine season, though again his form fell away somewhat towards the end,
lost his goal touch too. Probably needs a rest. 
I think he has to develop a bit more to his game, his
movement is good, on and off the ball, but he's not really dominating games. 
As one of our few really saleable assets might be sold to raise money, hope it
doesn't happen, he's one of the players who could have a great future at the
club, and we need him if we're going to improve.
<h3>30. Anthony Gardner</h3>
<p>
Promising defender. Looked good, will improve with more experience. He certainly
seems to have the talent. But if we play four at the back, he's only going to
get a game if either King or Richards is injured. Looks a bit lost when
effectively playing left back. But might it be worth moving Ledley forward to
play defensive midfield, or settling on three at the back, which we currently
play only to accommodate Ziege?
<h3>36. Dean Richards</h3>
<p>
I'm still not convinced that he's a top class defender. But he seemed to be getting
better, strong in the tackle and in the air, fairly quick, and also quite
comfortable playing the ball out from the back. The defence certainly seemed
even worse when he wasn't playing.
<h3>44. Kazuyuki Toda</h3>
<p>
Seemed enthusiastic enough, some decent performances in defensive midfield role.
Could turn out to be the new Steffen Freund, certainly seems to have the
same shooting ability. Needs to play more games to see if he can adjust to the
English game. Or is it just a ploy to sell more shirts in Japan?
<h2>The Manager</h2>
<p>
So Glenn hasn't turned out to be the Messiah after all. It's rumoured that the
club can't afford to sack him even if they want to. But if he really can't
motivate the players, then it's cheaper to get a new manager than a new team.
But all the speculation seems a bit over the top to me, fuelled by media
interest in Spurs, which is greater than our recent record justifies. 
Look at Charlton, whose end of
season collapse was even worse than ours. But I don't see any "Curbs must go"
headlines, or discontent in the fans; no ex-players lining up to say how
dreadful things are. Of course, I don't take much interest in Charlton, so
maybe I've missed it. The fact is that Spurs, and Hoddle, are more of a story
than most clubs and managers.
<p>
Glenn certainly does seem to have had problems with player relations in his
managerial career. I particularly remember him not exactly being popular
with some of the England players, and I know there was some discontent at
Chelsea (read Tony Cascarino's book). But a lot of talk about motivation is
just talk. Players are happy when they're winning and they whine and bitch
when they're not, or when they're not being picked, or generally when they
disagree with the manager, or they're angling for a move with a fatter pay
cheque. And the media is always happy to report knocking copy. Glenn has
certainly got an arrogant streak, and he doesn't take kindly to criticism.
But that doesn't seem to set him apart among managers, it's only a problem
when he's not successful.
<p>
Can Spurs be successful with Hoddle in charge? Well he said it would take five
years, and after two we don't seem any further forward, which is not
encouraging. If we start next season like we finished this one, then we are
relegation candidates. If that does happen, then I would think Glenn will
be out before Christmas, whatever it costs. £3 million to sack your manager
is peanuts when it'll cost £15 million if you get relegated.
But if a new man comes in, you can bet that he'll be talking about how
you can't turn things round quickly, and how the club needs stability. Of course,
sacking your manager every two years kind of goes against that philosophy.
But if we can get
some better players in over the summer, and settle on a team plan and a way
of playing, then there's no reason why we can't start next season like we
started this one. We just have to keep it up for nine months instead of two.
<p>
I guess we really have to consider whether Spurs can be successful under any
manager. 
Can any clubs still challenge the Arsenal/Man. Utd. monopoly? You have to
believe that it can be done.
