Dear Sirs,

DataCo_NBCAD_16624 

We write on behalf of the Football Data Co Limited which is the appointed licensee of 
the FA Premier League, the Football League, the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish 
Football League ("the Leagues") in respect of the licensing of certain intellectual 
property rights of the Leagues, including those in the fixture lists for this season 
August 2007 - May 2008 ("the Fixture Lists"), for use by third parties.

We have noticed that your website
http://www.ariley.co.uk/spurs/fixtures/fixtures2007-2008.html 
is displaying Football Fixtures. In order to display the Fixture Lists you must either 
obtain the necessary license from Football DataCo (dfolker@football-dataco.com) or be an 
officially nominated fanzine for your chosen club. If you are not nominated as the 
official club fanzine and you do not wish to purchase a fixture license you can post a 
link to your club's official site. 

Without nominated fanzine status or a license there is no provision for any fixture to 
appear in advance of the match being played. However, if there is an editorial preview 
of the next upcoming match in which the fixture is mentioned then this is unlikely to be 
objected to provided this is done in a clearly editorial form. Mentioning more than one 
fixture would not be accepted.

We thank you for your cooperation.

Yours sincerely,

Philip Stubbs
