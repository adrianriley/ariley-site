<h1>My Reply</h1>
<p>When I first read your email I thought it was some kind of joke. But after a little investigation it looks as though you are actually serious. It's a strange world where the listing of known facts on a website can be controlled in this way. I must say that I find it very hard to stretch my understanding of the term "intellectual property" to cover a schedule of football fixtures. One might as well try to establish rights over the publication of Brian Barwick's birthday, or John Terry's height.

Still, as I am sure you expect, I have neither the time nor the resources to challenge you in any meaningful way, and it scarcely seems worth it when the same information is available in many locations on the web. On the plus side, your investigations may have pushed my site's visitor numbers to double figures this month. Therefore I have removed the future fixtures from my site and instead inserted links to the data in other locations. I find it impossible to imagine that this has achieved the slightest benefit for your organisation or any other body or person in the entire world. But I expect it gives you the same kind of satisfaction as a nightclub bouncer turning away someone wearing trainers or a traffic warden ticketing a car parked marginally over the edge of a parking bay, both jobs for which you would seem eminently well suited when your employers realize the utter pointlessness of your job.
